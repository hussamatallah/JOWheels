Developed a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The website features a clean and responsive design, easy navigation, and interactive elements to enhance user experience.
This project helped me improve my front-end development skills and establish a professional online presence.
